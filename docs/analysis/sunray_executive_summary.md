# Sunray: Complete Web Application Security Platform
## Executive Summary for Business Leaders

---

## The Problem: Fragmented & Expensive Web Security

Most organizations protect their web applications with **multiple expensive services**:
- Authentication service: $60-200 per user annually
- Web Application Firewall (WAF): $2,400-24,000 annually
- DDoS protection: $2,400-24,000 annually  
- Bot management: $600-6,000 annually
- Content delivery network: $600-6,000 annually

**Total annual cost: $6,000-60,000+ per application**

These fragmented solutions create:
- ❌ **Complex management** across multiple vendors
- ❌ **Security gaps** between different services
- ❌ **Unpredictable costs** that scale with attacks and traffic
- ❌ **Deployment complexity** requiring specialized expertise
